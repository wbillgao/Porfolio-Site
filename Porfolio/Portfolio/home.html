                            Bill Gao is a Canadian-Chinese UX designer based in Vancouver, Canada. He was born in Vancouver and grew up in a household that fostered his interest in design and technology. Bill is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Interactive Arts and Technology (IAT) at Simon Fraser University, where he's developed a passion in human-computer itneraction and user experience design. 
    <!--
                            During his studies, Bill worked as a Junior UX/UI Designer at a startup called Onigiri, where he worked on developing a fundraising software for startup founders. He collaborated closely with the development team and conducted user studies to explore the fundraising space in an effort to create a user-friendly interface that simplified the fundraising process. This experience solidified Bill's passion for UX design and inspired him to pursue a career in the field.

                            He hopes to work on projects that have a positive impact on society, such as healthcare apps or educational software. Bill is also interested in exploring the intersection of design and technology with other fields, such as art and social sciences.

                            Outside of school and work, Bill enjoys playing Ultimate frisbee, soccer, and trying new restaurants with friends. He's also involving himself in the local design community, attending meetups and conferences to learn from other designers and share his own experiences.
